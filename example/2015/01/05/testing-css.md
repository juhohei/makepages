### Testing CSS

A paragraph. This paragraph has [a link](http://www.example.com), which is turquoise in color.
If you hover it, it'll be underlined. Here's some more text just to make the paragraph at least
three rows in length.

Second paragraph with `inline code`. It has a turquoise color with gray background. Next up is
a block of code. It should have black background and white text.

    function hello (name) {
      name = name || "world";
      return "Hello " + name + "!";
    }


> This is a blockquote. It has two paragraphs as it is very witty and
> from a super important person.
>
> Here's the thing which will amaze you in its widsom.
<cite>A famous person</cite>
